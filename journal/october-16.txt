Today I followed my goals - I completed my morning routine and read a chapter of a book.
I didnâ€™t watch youtube/twitch/porn.
I also went for a walk.

Wrote new goals, hoping to keep the journal properly this time.
Writing it the following day was a failure so now I will complete it throughout the day.
Today as of 1:42pm I still need to have a shower, wash my face and read for one hour.
Right now im going to go on the exercise bike.
